Data Science Project Overview:
Welcome to the repository for my data science projects! This README file provides a comprehensive overview of my projects, including its purpose and structure.


Project Objective:
The objective of this data science projects is to analyze numerous machine learning problems like(classification problem[Binary_Classification and multiple classification, Image/video Classification{CNN}], Linear regression analysis and Natural Language Preprocessing{NLP}) using historical data from datahubs like KAGGLE. This involves data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

Project Structure:
The repository is organized as follows:

data/: Contains raw and processed data files.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks natively on Vs-code used for data exploration and model development.

scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
.
models/: Saved model files.

results/: Output files, including visualizations and model performance metrics.

README.md: Project overview


Key Features:
Data Processing: Scripts and notebooks for cleaning and transforming data.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Interactive notebooks with visualizations and insights.

Model Building: Implementation of various machine learning(ML)/deep learning(DL) models.

Evaluation: Metrics and plots to assess model performance.


Results:
The key findings and model performance metrics are documented in the results/ directory. Visualizations and summary reports provide insights into the data and model predictions.


Framework/Libraries Used:
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Plotly-Express, TensorFlow, Keras, SQL, Excel, Pyspark, Spacy, LangChain, Streamlit, Fastapi, Pydantic, Uvicorn
