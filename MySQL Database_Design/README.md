                                  **MYSQL Database Design**
**Overview**
This database design was created by **[Mezue Obiora]**. Contributions and feedbacks are welcome!

The repository contains the SQL/MySQL database design for:

**Blogpost**:I designed this database to store, manage blog posts, comments and users.[SQL]

**Bank-Transaction**:My goal of this database is to provide an efficient and reliable system for managing bank transaction like store and manage transaction data, track account balance, provide transaction history and enhance customer service.[SQL]

**Virtual-course**: This database is a comprehensive online repository designed to manage and store information related to virtual course. The database stores course information including titles, description and duration. It manages instructor profiles, including qualification, expertise and also tracks student enrollments. Below is the enhanced entity relationship diagram(EER) of the database schema.[MySQL-Workbench]

**Flight-booking system**: This database keep tracks of flight which comprises passenger details, flight-details, aircraft/airlines, luggages and payment-gateways. The database enables efficient organization, retrival and analysis of flight data. Below is the EER diagram of the database schema[MySQL-Workbench]

These design are structured to ensure efficient data storage, retrieval, and integrity.

**Features of these databases**
                    
Scalable and Modular Design:I designed these database to support future enhancements.

Data Normalization: I ensured elimination of redundancy and dependency.

Integrity Constraints: I implemented primary and foreign keys, unique constraints, datatypes and checks to maintain data validity.

**NB:** I made use of MySQL-Workbench and SQL in implementing these database designs
