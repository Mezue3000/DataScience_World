The repository contains the SQL database design for:

**Blogpost**:I designed this database to store, manage blog posts, comments and users.[SQL]

These design are structured to ensure efficient data storage, retrieval, and integrity.

**Features of these databases**
                    
Scalable and Modular Design: Designed to support future enhancements.

Data Normalization: I Ensured elimination of redundancy and dependency.

Integrity Constraints: I implemented primary and foreign keys, unique constraints, datatypes and checks to maintain data validity.

**NB:** I made use of MySQL-Workbench and SQL in implementing these database designs
