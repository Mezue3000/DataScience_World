This is a Kaggle dataset for loan acquisition which has different features like income, occupation, age, marital status e.t.c. i performed some wrangling on the dataset like scaling the dataset, converting categorical features to numeric. i also visualized the data by plotting some charts that helps in interpreting the hidden information about the loan dataset, i modelled the data using deep neural network, compiled, trained, evaluated and predicted the model...Finalloy i exported the data by building a FastAPI app that allow users to send input data and receive model predictions in real time.
