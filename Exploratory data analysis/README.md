This is a hands-on explolatory data analysis(EDA), wrangling and modelling of a detailed car dataset. here i cleaned my data by imputing values to the nan_datapoints, removal of duplicates, dropped redundant features, scaled with Robust-scalar; checked-out for outliers and did feature transformation on categorical columns. ....I also performed some visualization to gain hidden insight about the data. Finally i trained the model with neural networks(FNN)...(NB:I got this csv data from Kaggle)
