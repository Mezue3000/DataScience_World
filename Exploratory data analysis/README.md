This is a hands-on data explolatory data analysis(EDA) and wrangling. here i cleaned my data by imputing values to the nan_datapoints, removal of duplicates, dropped redundant features, scaled with Standard-scalar; checked-out for outliers and did feature transformation on categorical columns. Thereby, showing my competence in getting my dataset preprocessed and fit for training....I also performed some visualization to gain hidden insight about the data....(NB:I got this csv data from Kaggle)
